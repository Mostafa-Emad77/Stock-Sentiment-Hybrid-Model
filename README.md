# Stock Price Prediction and Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices by creating a hybrid model that combines numerical analysis of historical stock data and sentiment analysis of news headlines. The project involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- **Stock Data:** Download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
- **News Headlines:** Collect news headlines related to the stock from a suitable source.
**Note:** The dataset for news headlines can be downloaded from this link: [Headlines Dataset](https://bit.ly/36fFPI6).

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Stock Data:** Clean the stock data, handle missing values, and format the data into a DataFrame.
- **News Headlines:** 
  - Tokenization: Tokenize the headlines to break them into individual words.
  - Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the headlines to quantify sentiment.
  - Preprocessing: Apply necessary preprocessing steps, such as removing stop words and special characters.

### 3. Feature Engineering

- **Stock Data:** Calculate technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI).
- **Combined Data:** Merge the preprocessed news headlines with the stock data based on the common date.

### 4. Merged Data Exploration

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the merged data to understand the relationships between different features.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examine the correlation between numerical features and the target variable ('Close').

### 5. Model Building

- **Hybrid Model:** Use a machine learning algorithm, such as Random Forest, to build a hybrid model that incorporates both numerical features from stock data and sentiment features from news headlines.

### 6. Model Evaluation

- **Metrics:** Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and other relevant performance metrics.
- **Visualization:** Create visualizations, such as plots of stock prices, technical indicators, and model predictions.

### 7. Fine-Tuning

- **Parameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the model parameters to improve performance.

### 8. Save Merged DataFrame

- **Save DataFrame:** Save the merged DataFrame, which contains both stock data and preprocessed headlines, as a new CSV file for future use.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of a hybrid model for stock price prediction, combining numerical analysis and sentiment analysis. It provides insights into the relationship between news sentiment and stock performance.
